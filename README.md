# DemoVue3

To follow demo step by step: You can run each script in vue-demo-scripts individually to follow progression.

```bash
./vue-demo-scripts/0_vuejs_setup.sh
./vue-demo-scripts/1_...
./vue-demo-scripts/2_...
```

To get the complete version:

```bash
./build_demo.sh
```

The source code is re-generated each time you run the script.

So to keep png downloaded from outside:

```bash

git restore demo-vue3/src/assets/ex-python.png
git restore demo-vue3/src/assets/python.png

```
